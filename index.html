    <h1>Wich is better, ice cream or cake?</h1>
    <p>Ice cream is obviously better than cake</p>
    <p>
      Ice cream is definitely better than cake! I think ice cream is better
      because:
    </p>
    <p>.It's cold and refreshing</p>
    <p>.It comes in a bunch of great flavors</p>
    <p>.It doesn't get stale</p>
    <h2>Also, ice cream is great because:</h2>
    <p>1.You can buy it easily from any store</p>
    <p>2.You can put toppings on it</p>
